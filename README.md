# wox-specifiler
Custom plugin for Wox to lookup specific files.
I didn't want to use `Everything` since it loads up "everything" (not ideal for certain file lookups) and Wox didn't have a specific plugin to allow me to lookup files that I use regularly with least effort.
So I wrote my own (leveraging some of the existing Wox plugins as a starting point).
Feel free to clone, use, etc. I'm not responsible for any issues it may cause.

Below is a rundown of the plugin:
